## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**
   - Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check for TypeScript errors

2. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Ensure variables start with `VITE_`
   - Check variable names match exactly
   - Redeploy after adding variables

3. **Routing Issues**
   - Verify `_redirects` file is in `public/` folder
   - Check `netlify.toml` redirects configuration

4. **API Errors**
   - Verify Groq API key is valid
   - Check API key has proper permissions
   - Test API key in development first

### Performance Optimization

1. **Bundle Size**
   - Monitor bundle size in build output
   - Use dynamic imports for large components
   - Optimize images and assets

2. **Caching**
   - Static assets are cached for 1 year
   - HTML files are not cached
   - API responses should not be cached

## Monitoring

### Analytics
- Set up Netlify Analytics
- Monitor page views and user behavior
- Track error rates

### Performance
- Use Netlify's built-in performance monitoring
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Set up alerts for performance issues

## Security

### Headers
- Security headers configured in `netlify.toml`
- XSS protection enabled
- Content type sniffing disabled

### API Security
- API keys stored as environment variables
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- CORS properly configured

## Backup and Recovery

### Data Backup
- User notebooks stored in localStorage
- No server-side data to backup
- Consider implementing cloud storage for production

### Rollback Plan
- Keep previous deployments available
- Test rollback process
- Document rollback steps

## Success Criteria

The deployment is successful when:
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] All core functionality works
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Mobile experience is smooth
- [ ] AI validation works with proper API key
- [ ] User can create and save notebooks
- [ ] Error handling works properly

## Next Steps After Deployment

   - Test all features thoroughly
   - Get feedback from users
   - Monitor performance metrics

2. **Optimization**
   - Implement user feedback
   - Optimize based on usage patterns
   - Add new features as needed

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up error tracking
   - Monitor user engagement
   - Track conversion metrics
